## 📖 About The Project

This project is a dedicated training environment ("Lomda") for the **Lionet** device. The primary goal is to qualify soldiers and operators on how to fully operate the device, understand its requirements, and master its interface without the risk of mishandling real operational equipment.

**The platform simulates the device's OS and provides:**
* **General Operation**: Guidance on how to operate the device correctly.
* **System Navigation**: Familiarity with the home screen and settings.
* **App-Specific Training**: Dedicated modules for each application installed on the device.

## 🎯 Current Module: Connectivity & VPN

The current version focuses on the critical initial setup: establishing a secure connection.
* Simulating the secure browser environment.
* Step-by-step guide for enabling the VPN.
* Troubleshooting common connection errors.

## 🔜 Future Roadmap

This project is built to be scalable. Future updates will include interactive training modules for **all device applications**, such as:
* [ ] Navigation & Maps Apps
* [ ] Secure Communication Tools
* [ ] Camera & Documentation
* [ ] Device Maintenance & Settings
