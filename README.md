## 📖 About The Project

This project was developed to simulate the Operating System interface of the "Lionet" device. The goal is to provide a safe, "sandbox" environment where soldiers and operators can practice technical procedures without risking real equipment configuration.

**Key Scenarios:**
* Navigating the device interface.
* Identifying connection errors.
* Establishing a secure VPN tunnel via a dedicated app.
